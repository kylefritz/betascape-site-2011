Betascape attendees will be given space and in some cases resources,
to come together to work on mini projects where they can explore new
ideas and concepts that emerge from the series of Betascape events. Some
CreateCamp projects will be preplanned and many will be the spontaneous
result of inspiration and new ideas. From 4-5PM, CreateCamp Projects
will be presented, and awards will be given for the most novel and
innovative projects. Note: We will be making a list of facilitators
public shortly and we encourage you to reach out to them if you want to
collaborate with them on a project

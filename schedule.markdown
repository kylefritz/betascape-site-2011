 * Computers Suck, The Internet Rules: How to make networked stuff that interacts with the real world. - Computers suck, the internet rules: learn how to do ridiculous stuff like plug your coffee maker into the internet and control it via twitter.
 * Kinect Programming in 45 minutes. - You will gain first-hand experience building technology that makes use of Kinect. Specifically, you will be shown how we can connect Kinect to an SNES emulator, as an example how you can also connect Kinect to any device/hardware/project you want.
 * Make Art with Bristlebots (A tiny directional vibrobot) - The BristleBot is a simple and tiny robot with an agenda. The ingredients? One toothbrush, a battery, and a pager motor. The result? Serious fun.

 * Mutate 101 - Mutate 101 will give workshop participants the opportunity to make an object that both transforms and inhibits the body while simultaneously allowing them to gain a new ability or purpose. This workshop is an exercise in thinking outside of conventional body adornment and function.  Techniques to be covered:  wet felting (wool), needle felting (wool), basic hand sewing techniques and creative attachment of found objects (most objects will be battery operated or electrical).

In one workshop, learn to build contact micrphones the CMKT4 way. In a second workshop, learn the secrets of Circuit Bending and build a Bending Buddy. After the workshops, listen to CMKT4's unique blend of circuit bending, handmade electronics, and rock music.
 * Introduction to Arduino's: Everything you need to know to get up and running - Come to learn what an arduino is, what it can do and how you to quickly and easily prototype your projects.
 * Introduction to Processing - Developed by Ben Fry and Casey Reas Processing is meant to be a programming language for visual artists to conceptualize and develop their ideas. Used in data visualizations, generative art and interactive exhibits it's versatile for whatever you want to do.

Betascape attendees will be given space and in some cases resources,
to come together to work on mini projects where they can explore new
ideas and concepts that emerge from the series of Betascape events. Some
CreateCamp projects will be preplanned and many will be the spontaneous
result of inspiration and new ideas. From 4-5PM, CreateCamp Projects
will be presented, and awards will be given for the most novel and
innovative projects. Note: We will be making a list of facilitators
public shortly and we encourage you to reach out to them if you want to
collaborate with them on a project

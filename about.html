<h2>Betascape Overview</h2>
<p>Betascape 2011 is a multi-day experience designed to bring artists and
technologists together to Learn and Connect to Create. Attendees will
participate in one day of learning and workshopping and a one-day
CreateCamp.  The goal is to inspire artists and technologists to
innovate at the intersection of art and technology in a whole new way.
Betascape also aims to drive greater economic development for Baltimore
by attracting and retaining technologists, artists and new companies.
Betascape will be held from September 23 - 25th 2011 on Station North in
Baltimore, Maryland, a designated Arts and Entertainment District in
Baltimore City.</p>

<p>The event is being organized by a group of volunteers, working in
either technology or web design.  Our long term goal is to establish an
annual event that is imparting real skills and providing new ideas and
relationships for people to innovate @ the intersection of art and
tech.</p>

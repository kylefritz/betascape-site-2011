  <h2>Betascape Overview</h2>
  <p>Betascape 2011 is a multi-day experience designed to bring artists and
  technologists together to Learn and Connect to Create. Attendees will
  participate in one day of learning and workshopping and a one-day
  CreateCamp.  The goal is to inspire artists and technologists to
  innovate at the intersection of art and technology in a whole new way.
  Betascape also aims to support the growing community of artists and technologists
  in and around Baltimore, in order to drive greater economic development.
  Betascape will be held from September 23 - 25th 2011 in Station North in
  Baltimore, Maryland, a designated Arts and Entertainment District in
  Baltimore City.</p>

  <p>The event is being organized by a group of volunteers, working in 
  technology and design fields in Baltimore. Our long term goal is to establish an
  annual event that is imparting real skills and providing new ideas and
  relationships for people to innovate @ the intersection of art and
  tech.</p>

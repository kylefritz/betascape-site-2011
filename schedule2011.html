<p>Outlet is dedicated time for bringing interesting people together offline to cut through the noise and enjoy good company. We believe that doing this has great, if perhaps unmeasurable, value.</p>

<p>Accomplish that much first. Then, if the fit is right, we can talk a little business.</p>

<h2>Saturday 5PM - 12am: Station North Block Party at Betascape</h2> 
<p>After your day of learning &amp; listening, come relax or even rock out at the Station North Music Festival. This event is free and open to the public.</p> 
<h2>Sunday 9AM - 5PM: CreateCamp</h2>  
<p>Betascape attendees will be given space and in some cases resources, to come together to work on mini projects where they can explore new ideas and concepts that emerge from the series of Betascape events. Some CreateCamp projects will be preplanned and many will be the spontaneous result of inspiration and new ideas. From 4-5PM, CreateCamp Projects will be presented, and awards will be given for the most novel and innovative projects. Note: We will be making a list of facilitators public shortly and we encourage you to reach out to them if you want to collaborate with them on a project</p>
